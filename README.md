# A collection of paid tech products, services and education platforms that offer 7-day (or more!) free trials.

![code editor with text on front that says 7 say free trial the ultimate list of tech products, services and education](https://realtoughcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tech-products-7-day-free-trial-github.jpg)

## Tech stuff is pricey. Try before you buy! 

# Nov 3 update: This is a huge Work In Progress and I will be adding a heaving helping of freebies in the next couple weeks. I'll also be sharing this repo [on a livestream](https://www.youtube.com/realtoughcandy) next month with all the updates. 

Most free trials are valid for new accounts only. In other words, if you've signed up for a free trial on one of these platforms in the past, your account probably isn't eligible for another one. 

**Students: Get a royal boatload of free stuff through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).** (I won't be listing GitHub Studend Pack benefits in this list)

_Some of the links here are affiliates. That means if you end up going past the free trial & buying soemething, I may earn a few bucks. It's a free way of supporting repos like these, so thank you for your support!_
