# A collection of paid tech products, services and education platforms that offer free 7-day (or more!) trials.

![code editor with text on front that says 7 say free trial the ultimate list of tech products, services and education](https://realtoughcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tech-products-7-day-free-trial-github.jpg)

## Tech stuff is pricey. Try before you buy! 

Most free trials are valid for new accounts only. In other words, if you've signed up for a free trial on one of these platforms in the past, your account probably isn't eligible for another one. 

_Some of the links here are affiliates. That means if you end up going past the free trial & buying soemething, I may earn a few bucks. It's a free way of supporting repos like these, so thank you for your support!_
