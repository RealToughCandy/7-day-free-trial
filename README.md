# A collection of tech education platforms that offer free 7-day (or more!) trials.

![code editor with text on front that says 7 say free trial the ultimate list for programmers](https://realtoughcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-day-free-trial-tech-education-1.jpg)

Tech education platforms can be pricey. Try before you buy! 

Most free trials are valid for new accounts only. In other words, if you've signed up for a free trial on one of these platforms in the past, your account probably isn't eligible for another one. 

_Some of the links here are affiliates. That means if you end up going past the free trial & buying soemething, I may earn a few bucks. It's a free way to support repos like these, so thank you for your support!_
